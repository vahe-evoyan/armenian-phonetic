## [Armenian Phonetic Keyboard Layout](http://evoyan.org/armenian-phonetic-for-mac)

### Armenian phonetic keyboard layout for Mac OSX.

This project was initiated as an alternative keyboard layout for those who have an experience of working with Armenian Phonetic layout in Windows/Linux. It basically is created from scratch using [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele) tool on Mac for editing keyboard layouts. It is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/vahe-evoyan/armenian-phonetic) page. Please feel free to file bugs right on [Github](https://github.com/vahe-evoyan/armenian-phonetic/issues). I'll do my best to address them as quickly as possible.

Below are brief instructions on the layout set-up.

#### Included Layouts

* Armenian Phonetic - Regular phonetic layout where key "R" types "Ö€".
* Armenian Phonetic (KDWin) - Exactly the same layout as in KDWin.
* Armenian Phonetic With English - Option key changes the keys to English in place of special characters.
* Armenian Phonetic (KDWin) With English - KDWin phonetic layout with Option key feature.

#### How To Install
1. Download [ArmenianPhonetic.dmg](https://github.com/vahe-evoyan/armenian-phonetic/releases/download/v2.1.2/ArmenianPhonetic.dmg) file from the releases section.

2. Drag the `ArmenianPhonetic.bundle` file to the `Keyboard Layouts` folder.
3. The system will ask you to authenticate, as the directory requires super user access.

4. The layouts should appear in the *Language & Text* (or System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources) preferences section. In case they didn't, simply log out and log back in, so that the OS reloads the layouts.

- or if you fluent with terminal and git tools you can run the following command(it clones git repo into folder, copy needed files into layouts directory and cleanups/deletes the git repo folder):
